## Guidelines for Crit  

**Crit is conversation.** This is the opposite of defense, which is the practice most of us with a liberal arts education learn. In defense, you define your argument, and defend it to people who present evidence and arguments that question your argument's position. In critique, you show others what you've been thinking about and doing and where you think your work is going, and they engage with those positions through conversation. 

**Crit centers on in-process work.** Because crit is conversation and not defense, people bring work that's in process and unfinished to crit. No need to present a deck and definitely no need to bring fully formed thoughts. Ideas at any stage of development are welcome. We will present Digital Ecosystem Goals that the EDX team has developed, but that doesn't mean they're finished; we need your thoughts and input; these goals are in-process.

**Crit starts from a sticking point.** Because crit deals with developing work, the people doing the work outline for the group where they're sort of stuck and where they want help: do they want feedback on a certain part of the work? Are they looking for ways to connect it to other work that's in flight? Are they looking for ideas because they feel blocked or siloed? Do they want a reality check on whether this has all been done before or whether it's feasible? Asks like that are useful to direct the conversation. EDX will be asking you for feedback on each goal, in terms of word usage and cross-functional applicability of these goals throughout GSA. 

**Crit is energetic.** What everyone is looking for is to walk away from crit with more ideas and energy around the work. Sometimes, the people doing the work walk away with more ideas that are a bit confusing or even disheartening, but sometimes those less-fun emotions are part of idea development. 

**Crit is future-facing.** What both the people doing the work and the group should always feel walking away from crit is supported in the work by the greater team. Even if the workers find that the ideas don't have the breadth or latitude they thought they did or they have the less fun emotions mentioned above, crit should feel like a positive investment in their work. If and when it feels like a take-down or a bit of an attack, then that's not proper crit; that's what some orgs call a "murder board", and it's not what we practice. 

**Crit takes practice.** Most of us practice either reporting out or poking holes in ideas every day, and those are useful skills! But we do them so often and we're so good at them that when we're asked to engage with other people's ideas in a constructive and conversational way, it can be hard. Crit takes practice, just like reporting out and poking holes does. It's a way of thinking and talking and relating to your colleagues' work that we don't do that often in our professional lives. So don't worry about it if you're not sure what any of this means; just come to the DC prepared to have a conversation.
