#### What is Digital Experience?

Digital experience describes all the interactions people have with an organization via digital channels. GSAâ€™s Enterprise Digital Experience (EDX) Team, part of the Service Design Program in GSA's Office of Customer Experience (OCE), leads and coordinates efforts to improve digital experience across GSA, working closely with GSAâ€™s Digital Council (Council) and Digital Experience Executive Board (Board).

#### Initiatives

GSAâ€™s work to improve digital governance and implement the [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) legislation resulted in the creation of the EDX Team, the Council, and the Board. EDX Team initiatives include:

* Validation of GSAâ€™s [Website Inventory](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/admin/websites/) via Touchpoints (for reference: [Touchpoints Data Dictionary](https://github.com/GSA/EDX/blob/main/Data/touchpoints-data-dictionary-2021-11.csv))
* Documenting a [Digital Lifecycle Program](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/communications/websites/policies-and-guidelines/digital-lifecycle-program) to improve creation, management, and sunsetting of GSA websites and digital properties
* Coordinating [enterprise web modernization efforts](https://github.com/GSA/wg-web-modernization) related to 21st Century IDEA
* Collaborating with the Office of Strategic Communication and GSA IT to lead the Digital Council, support the Executive Board, and improve knowledge sharing across GSA on initiatives to improve digital experience.
* Leading GSA's internal [Digital Community of Practice](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/gsadigitalcop).
