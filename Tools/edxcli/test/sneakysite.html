    <h1>Sneaky Test Site</h1>
    <p>
      This is a sneaky site which attempts to fool the scanner by using terms
      and patterns which don't actually meet the spirit of the evaluations.

      It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am
      going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid
      simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the
      restfulness of his companyâ€”for he did all the talking. We fell together,
      as modest people will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown
      through, and he at once began to say things which interested me.
